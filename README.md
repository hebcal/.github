Welcome!

Hebcal (pronounced _HEEB-kal_, as in **Heb**rew **cal**endar) is a perpetual Jewish calendar program. It includes tools to help you generate a list of Jewish holidays for any year (past, present or future). Also available are a Hebrew date converter, Shabbat candle lighting times and Torah readings. Create a personal list of Yahrzeit (memorial) dates.

Hebcal is available in Go, JavaScript, Swift, C, Java and Perl.

The key routines are translations of Dershowitz & Reingold's lisp code in GNU-Emacs 18.
